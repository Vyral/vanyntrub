I’m getting a lot of questions about our market lately, so I’ll take a moment to fill you in on what’s happening. Inventory is low, which means sellers have a good chance at selling at a higher price. Interest rates are historically low, which means buyers can afford more of a home. **In short, our market is very hot.**

If you have any questions or are thinking of buying or selling, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help.
