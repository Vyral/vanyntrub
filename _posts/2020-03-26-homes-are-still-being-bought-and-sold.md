It’s the topic on everyone’s minds: the coronavirus. This pandemic has altered a lot of things, but based on the numbers we see on the MLS, homes are still selling and people are still buying them. The number of showings has decreased, but the quality of those showings has improved. While more people are spending time at home, they can use this period to prepare their house for sale when things get back to normal. Now is a great time to paint, update carpet, and do any other updates your property needs.
