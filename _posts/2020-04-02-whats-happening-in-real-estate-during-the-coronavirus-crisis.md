Today we’re stopping by to give you just a quick update on the real estate market and how it has been affected in the wake of COVID-19. We all know that the stock market has been hit hard, but real estate hasn’t quite followed the same path. People still need to buy and sell homes, even during a global pandemic. During March, new listings increased by 21.7%, pending sales went up 16%, and the months’ supply of homes decreased by 11.1%. Home showings are slowing down but they haven’t stopped.&nbsp;
